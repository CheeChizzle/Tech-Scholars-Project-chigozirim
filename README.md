### Background info
  The date is 1903, and the player is Mary Church Terrell. She is a teacher in the
Latin department at M Street High School, one of the most prestigious African American
educational institutions to have ever existed in the United States.

Her class of 10th grade students are extremely astute and normally diligent, but it doesn’t
seem like they’re in the mood to sit through her usual Latin lecture this afternoon. They’re
drowsy, and one by one, they each start falling asleep.

As Mrs. Terrell, you must keep all the students awake before Mrs. Anna J. Coope, the principal of M
Street High School, walks in.

### Enjoy!
